## 📝 The Story Behind / Problem Statement  <a name = "a_0_TSB"></a>

<p align="justified"> For the past four years (2018-2021), Mr. P has diligently used an Excel workbook to track his monthly income, savings, and expenses. Lately, he's been feeling concerned about his spending habits. Recognizing his tendency for impulsive online shopping and occasional neglect of saving, he's determined to handle his finances more prudently. He's convinced that leveraging data visualization can bring discipline to his finances.

<p align="justified"> Turning to his friend, Mr. H, a savvy Data Analyst, Mr. P seeks guidance. With Mr. H's help, he learned the basics of Power BI to harness its visualization prowess for wiser financial decision-making. Starting with a mock-up of the dashboard in PowerPoint, they gradually refined it into a functional version that Mr. P could integrate into his daily routine.

- Does his spending align with a healthy pattern?
- Is he on track to meet his savings goals?
- What is his net worth, as per the provided data?

Together, they dive into the analysis, striving to create a comprehensive financial overview that empowers Mr. P to steer his finances toward a more secure and informed future.
